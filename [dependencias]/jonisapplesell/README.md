## Configuration
In the config.lua you can change what items can be sold, you can also change the pawnshop location and other various things.
The default items in the config are items from my plugin [r3_prospecting](https://github.com/r3ps4J/r3_prospecting) so if you don't use this plugin change the items to items you have in your server.
